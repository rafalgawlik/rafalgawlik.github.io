I decide to config my own `.eth` domain - `rafalgawlik.eth`.

It's not really a practical decision. It's more something like a vote for cryptocurrencies ecosystem and try to be a part of new era. 
Ownership of the `.eth` domain contain some benefits:

1. easy way to receive crypto from another address (instead of long complicated address, you can use simple `<your-domain>.eth`)
2. store email, website URL, bio and social links
3. this is my first NFT
